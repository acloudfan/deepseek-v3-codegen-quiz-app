I would like you to create a javascript library named quiz_library.

Idea:
* The library will be used in a single page application for creating quizes.

Quizes:
* Question will be multiple choice questions
* Answer may be a single coorect choice or multiple choices
* Following json will be used to describe quiz with the list of questions

{
    "title": "Fundamentals of neural networks",
    "description": "This is a quiz that tests your knowledge of neural networks",
    "questions": [
        {
            "text": "Select the primary colors:",
            "description": "This is a quiz that tests your knowledge of neural networks",
            "choices": [
                {
                    "answer": "red",
                    "correct": 1
                },
                {
                    "answer": "blue",
                    "correct": 1
                },
                {
                    "answer": "pink",
                    "correct": 0
                    
                }
            ],
            "explanation": "this is a dummy explanation of why this option is not correct",
            "references": [
                {"title": "This is a good blog", "url": "https://test.com"},
                {"title": "This is a another blog", "url": "https://test.com"}
            ]
        },
        {
            "text": "Capital of USA",
            "description": "This is a quiz that tests your knowledge of neural networks",
            "choices": [
                {
                    "answer": "Washington DC",
                    "correct": 1
                },
                {
                    "answer": "New York",
                    "correct": 0
                },
                {
                    "answer": "Maryland",
                    "correct": 0
                }
            ],
            "explanation": "this is a dummy explanation of why this option is correct",
            "references": []
        }
